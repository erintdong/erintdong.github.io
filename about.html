		<p> I came to Canada in 1991, the daughter of Vietnamese immigrants. My family, like so many countless others before us, sought refuge in Canada in order to build a better life. When we first arrived, it was difficult for my parents to adjust – they were new to a country where they had no friends or family to turn to, they had no education or relevant work experience, and their lack of English held them back from advancing in life. In retrospect, I think my parents felt incredibly overwhelmed, lonely, and disoriented living in new lands far, far away from their native homes. I also think it’s the reason why my mother really pushed the importance of getting an education and being a good student. She wanted me to have the future that she couldn’t have, so I took her advice.

		<p> In elementary school and in high school, I focused on my studies. A lot. Eternally afraid of failure and taking risks, I would pour hours into studying, reading, writing, and whatever was necessary to do well and just… not fail. I then went on to do undergraduate studies at York University, where I graduated from the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies with a degree in English, and on the Dean’s Honour Roll in June 2016. For years, I dabbled with the possibility of becoming a teacher (especially during my studies at York) but eventually came to the realization that maybe, it just wasn’t for me. Maybe, I needed to make a change, take a risk, and do something completely out of my comfort zone.

		And I suppose that’s what I’m doing now. I used to immerse myself in the world of literature, the world of stories and characters, and happily-ever-afters. Now, I’m getting out of my comfort zone and tackling programming languages with the intention of becoming an accomplished, skilled web developer. My hope is to support and increase tech diversity in order to make the industry as inclusive as possible. Additionally, one of my aims is to work on ways to achieve sustainable development in and out of the tech world, so that we can enjoy resources today without compromising the needs of the future's generations.
